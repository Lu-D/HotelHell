# Hotel Hell

Don Choi and Daiwei (David) Lu

This game was developed for the GameMaker's Toolkit GameJam 2018 over 48 hours. 
It explores a tower defense game where you can not kill enemies or fire projectiles.

The goal of the game is to use attractions to space out enemies arriving into town so that they do not arrive all together.
